!hola!

I'm on a journey to become a skilled UI Design Engineer.

For now, I'd be documenting my projects here.

1. Flutterwave's Homepage Replica
   My first practice with HTML and CSS was replicating the homepage of Flutterwave's website.
   View here: [cveman1.github.io/flw](cveman1.github.io/flw)
   Original: https://flutterwave.com/ng

2. Password Generator
   Still working on the link
